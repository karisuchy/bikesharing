# bikesharing

## Overview
 
The goal of this challenge is to explore the possibility of a bike-share program in Des Moines, Iowa based on the program in New York City. The analysis was limited to data from August 2019 only. Tableau Public was used to analyze and visualize the data.   


## Results

The NYC program is extremely popular program with over 2.3 million rides in August 2019. The majority of these rides were taken by annual subscribers of the bike-sharing program.

As demonstrated in the chart below, the peak hours are at the beginning and ending times of typical day shift worker. This indicates a large number of customers use the bike program for their daily commute to and from work.

The vast majority of bike rides are less than 20 minutes. Males are much more likely to utilize this program than females.

## Summary

This analysis clearly demonstrated the popularity of NYC's program. However, Des Moines would be much better off analyzing bike-sharing date from a city with more demographic and geographic similarities to its own. In addition, it would be best to look at year-round data, preferably more than one years' worth to more fully understand potential interest and usage.
